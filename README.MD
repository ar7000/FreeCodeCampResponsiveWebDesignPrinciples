Furthering CSS revision via FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Principles resources and copying passed code to Git repo as I go through each task. Documenting below anything new I learn, or anything I am reminded of that I may have forgotten.

    - Learned use of viewport units to size elements:
        - The four different viewport units are:
        Viewport Width: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width
        Viewport Height: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height
        Viewport Minimum: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width)
        Viewport Maximum: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width)
